- Led the redesign of Cornell’s large-scale exam scheduling system using integer programming.
- Incorporated fairness constraints and instructor preferences into the optimization model.
- Scaled to 10,000+ decision variables using real-time Gurobi checkpointing.
- Reduced solver runtime by 80% while improving solution reliability.
- Decreased two-exam student conflicts by 16.5% through constraint refinement.
- Built a 6-layer MLP (≈3k parameters, 95% accuracy) to predict post-add enrollment.
- Used ML predictions to inform and improve optimization decisions.
- Collaborated with university administrators to iteratively refine constraints and objectives.
