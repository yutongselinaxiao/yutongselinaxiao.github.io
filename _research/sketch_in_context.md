- Built machine learning pipelines combining CNNs, VAEs, and GANs.
- Translated hand-drawn sketches into 3D signed-distance field representations.
- Generated mesh geometry from learned implicit representations.
- Engineered NVIDIA Omniverse–Photoshop extensions for architectural visualization.
- Streamlined design workflows by integrating ML-generated geometry into graphics tools.
