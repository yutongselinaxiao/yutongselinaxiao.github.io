I am a Ph.D. student in **Industrial & Systems Engineering** at the **University of Southern California**, advised by **Prof. Meisam Razaviyayn**. I received my B.S. in **Operations Research & Information Engineering** and **Computer Science** from **Cornell University**, where I worked on projects in integer programming, vision–language modeling, and machine learning for graphics and geometry.

My research interests lie broadly in **optimization and machine learning**, with a particular emphasis on **large-scale constrained optimization**, **first-order methods**, and **algorithmic design for modern learning systems**. I am interested in developing optimization algorithms that are both theoretically grounded and practically scalable.

Broadly, my research aims to bridge **theory, algorithms, and implementation** in optimization and learning.
